firstly get your packagejspn by using npm init -y
change the name of the main in your package json to your preffered
then install the dependencies like express npm install express
after which you install nodemon dependencies npm install nodemon --save--dev,
next thing to do is wrirte the script
i. we are writing the start script first
ii. then the dev 
iii. open a file call .gitignore
next you import your express and create a server
makee sure to make the app listen 

set up some basic routes 
i. home routes
ii. error routes


inside your pakage.json
beneat the test... you write    1,
 "start": "node app.js",
    "dev" : "nodemon app.js"


    (very important)
    create a file called .gitignore
    then type node_modules

    how establish a connection between MongoDb and the database
    First we build our simple server in app.js
    const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const PORT = 3000



then Listen function in other to run your npm run dev

app.listen(PORT, () =>{
    console.log(server running on port: ${PORT});
    
})


environmental variables- they work for sensitive information
two step to have aceess
i. installing dotenv
in our app.js first line of code require("dotenv").config()
create a file called .env
also add env to gitignore
in your env secret = mysecret


iportance of mongoose
i. it is used to create a schmema(how you want your information to look like, it defines how each document will look like)

valid data types acceped by mongodb
strings, array, number. date, boolean,buffer, objectid, mixed

create a schmema model that fits our projecct logic
